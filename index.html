          companies investing in ai models are facing billions in lawsuits.
          <br />
          Github, where this site is hosted, is currently in court for
          $9,000,000,000 in damages.
        </p>
        <p>
          these models are the playground for a new age of misinformation.
          <br />
          bigotry and prejudice will continue to be associated with ai outputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          they can only do this by scraping your public works. <br />
          they will not compensate you fairly for this. it would bankrupt them.

          any company open to ai art has decided that paying artists is not
          worth it. do not accept work from them. your labor and your reputation
          are not safe in their hands.
